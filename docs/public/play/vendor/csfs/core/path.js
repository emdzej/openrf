/**
 * Paths, and the archive fragment.
 *
 * A csfs path is POSIX-style and rooted, with one extra piece of syntax: `#`
 * separates a container from a path *inside* it.
 *
 *     /dessins/100.zip#/1132C000.png
 *     /outer.zip#/inner.zip#/deep/file.txt
 *
 * `#` was chosen over a second argument or a `zip://` scheme because it keeps
 * a location a single string. A path that survives being logged, stored in a
 * manifest, put in a URL fragment or handed between a worker and a page is
 * worth more than a tidier type — and every one of those places already
 * accepts a string.
 *
 * Nesting is supported for the same reason: it costs one loop, and the
 * alternative is a special case that someone eventually hits.

/**
 * Normalise a path: single leading slash, no trailing slash, no `.` or `..`.
 *
 * `..` is resolved rather than rejected, and cannot escape the root — a path
 * from a manifest or a URL is untrusted input, and `/a/../../etc` resolving to
 * `/etc` inside someone's data directory is the whole reason to do this here
 * rather than in each backend.
