/**
 * A file system over the origin private file system.
 *
 * OPFS is the same API as a picked directory, reached through
 * `navigator.storage.getDirectory()` instead of a prompt — so this reuses the
 * FSA backend rather than reimplementing it, and adds only what differs.
 *
 * What differs is worth knowing:
 *
 * - **No permission prompt, ever.** The origin owns this storage, so a
 *   remembered tree reopens silently. That is the reason to import into OPFS
 *   rather than to keep a directory handle: a picked directory loses its
 *   permission on reload, this does not.
 * - **It is evictable.** A browser may clear it under storage pressure unless
 *   `navigator.storage.persist()` has been granted, which is why `persist()`
 *   is offered here and why a consumer should call it before writing gigabytes.
 * - **`createSyncAccessHandle` could write in place**, avoiding the doubled
 *   write traffic `createWritable` costs — but only inside a worker, and this
 *   backend does not use it. Writes here stage and swap, as on a picked
 *   directory.
