/**
 * A file system over a directory handle.
 *
 * Two things about the File System Access API shape this, and both are worth
 * knowing before using it:
 *
 * **There is no path lookup.** A handle resolves one segment at a time, each a
 * round trip, so `/a/b/c/d.txt` costs four. Resolved directories are therefore
 * cached — a tree with 3,500 directories and 228,000 files would otherwise
 * re-walk the same parents for every file inside them.
 *
 * **Permission does not survive a reload.** A handle can be stored in
 * IndexedDB, because it is structured-cloneable, but `queryPermission` reports
 * `"prompt"` afterwards even for one the user granted yesterday, and
 * `requestPermission` only works inside a user gesture. So a remembered
 * directory cannot be reopened silently on boot; the interface has to offer a
 * button. `queryAccess` and `requestAccess` are here so a consumer can tell
 * the two situations apart instead of discovering it as a failure.
